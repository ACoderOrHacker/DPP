**D++** is a **power**, **fast** programming language.

### Description
D++ is a programming language that is designed to be easy to use and powerful. It is a scripting language that is similar to Python, but with a faster execution speed. It is also a compiled language, which means that it is translated into machine code before it is run, which makes it faster than interpreted languages like Python.

Just for fun.
